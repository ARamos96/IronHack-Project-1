Jimmy Jump!

This is my first project at IronHack. The objective was to create a basic 2D game with our knowledge and understanding of HTML, CSS and JavScript.

My game is a tap-tap game, similar to what FlappyBird used to be, in which a player (Jimmy), has to jump between running stewards. The objective is to see how far you can get. THE MORE STEWARDS YOU JUMP THE HIGHER YOUR SCORE WILL BE!

But be careful, crash against them or against the border of the screen and your run is over.

Hope you enjoy it!
